## Basics

Simply type a unit name in the "From Unit" edit window. As you type, the list
below the window will be filtered to show only matching units. Matching unit
names contain words starting with the words that are typed. Either type the
complete unit name/abbreviation or hit the return key to use the unit
highlighted (blue letters) in the list. Of course, clicking with the mouse on a
unit in the list will also add the unit to the edit window. You may also use
the up and down arrow keys to highlight nearby units from the list.

Repeat the unit selection in the "To Unit" edit window. When done, if the units
are compatible, the numeric edit windows below the unit lists will activate. A
number may be entered into either numeric window and the other window will
display the conversion result.
