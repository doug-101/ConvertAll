Why write another unit converter? There are plenty of them out there. Well, I
couldn't find one that worked quite the way I wanted.

With ConvertAll, you can combine the units any way you want. If you want to
convert from inches per decade, that's fine. Or from meter-pounds. Or from
cubic nautical miles. The units don't have to make sense to anyone else.

In addition to the installed version, there is also an online version.  See
<http://convertall-web.bellz.org> to try it out.

Also visit <http://convertall.bellz.org/index.html> for more information.
