## Non-Linear Conversions
---

The conversion of some units is non-linear. Examples of these include the
Fahrenheit and Celsius temperature scales (due to an offset zero point) and the
American Wire Gauge (logarithmic). Non-linear units are labeled as such in
the comments column.

These units can be converted only when they are not combined with other units
or used with an exponential operator. Otherwise the conversion would not be
meaningful.
