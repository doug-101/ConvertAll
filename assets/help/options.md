The "Settings" menu item allows for changing several default options. These
settings are automatically stored so that ConvertAll will re-start with the
settings last used.

The first options control the display of numerical results, including the use
of scientific notation and the number of decimal places. Be cautious about
setting the number of decimal places to a low value, which can result in a
significant loss of accuracy. Six places or higher is recommended (eight is the
default).

There is an option to set the number of recent units to be saved. Setting it to
zero will disable the recent unit button. Another option will automatically
load the most recent previous units at startup.

The remaining options control appearances.  The view scale ratio can be set to
make the content smaller or larger (useful for high-dpi displays). The window
size and position will be restored from the previous session use if enabled.
The final setting selects between light and dark color schemes.
