The "Options..." button allows for changing several default settings. These
settings are automatically stored so that ConvertAll will re-start with the
settings last used.

The first options control the display of numerical results, including the use
of scientific notation and the number of decimal places. Be cautious about
setting the number of decimal places to a low value, which can result in a
significant loss of accuracy. Six places or higher is recommended (eight is the
default).

There is an option to set the number of recent units to be saved. Setting it to
zero will disable the Recent Unit buttons. Another option will automatically
load the most recent previous units at startup.

There are options to hide the operator text buttons (first row), and the unit
buttons (second row). These can be hidden to save space if the keyboard will be
used to enter the operators.

Buttons are also included on the options dialog to control the colors of the
text fields.

Buttons are also included on the options dialog to control GUI colors and
fonts. Colors can be selected by theme or individually. Larger fonts can be
selected for use on high-resolution displays.
