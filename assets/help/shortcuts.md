When typing unit names, spaces are ignored, so they may be skipped. It is also
generally ignored if a plural form of the unit name is typed. For squared and
cubed units (positive exponents of 2 or 3) the "^" symbol does not need to be
typed.

When a partially typed unit is highlighted in the list (blue lettering),
hitting enter will complete the name. The up an ddown arrow keys can be used to
highlight nearby units in the list prior to hitting enter. The unit closet to
the cursor will be replaced.

The "Recent Unit" button opens a menu of recently used units and unit
combinations. The current unit combination is replaced with any selections from
this menu.

The tab key can be used to cycle between the "From" and "To" unit test boxes
and the "From" and "To" number editors.

The number to be converted may be entered in either the "From" or "To" unit
side. Standard or scientific notation may be used, or an expression including
the normal math operators (+, -, *, /, **) and parenthesis may be entered.
