            <h1>What is ConvertAll?</h1>

            <p>Why write another unit converter?  There are plenty of them
            out there.  Well, I couldn't find one that worked quite the way
            I wanted.</p>

            <p>With ConvertAll, you can combine the units any way you want.
            If you want to convert from inches per decade, that's fine.  Or
            from meter-pounds.  Or from cubic nautical miles.  The units
            don't have to make sense to anyone else.</p>

            <p>In addition to the installed version, there is also an online
            version.  See <a
            href="http://convertall-web.bellz.org">convertall-web.bellz.org</a>
            to try it out.</p>

            <p>A source code repository is available at <a
            href="https://github.com/doug-101/ConvertAll">GitHub</a>.</p>

            <h2>April 23, 2010 - Release 0.5.0</h2>

            <ul><b>New Features:</b>

              <li>Multiplication and division operators now have the same
              precedence.  In previous versions of ConvertAll, a series of
              units after a division symbol were assumed to be in the
              denominator.  Now, a division operator only affects the unit (or
              the unit group in parenthesis) immediately after the
              operator.</li>

              <li>Parenthesis are now supported to group units in the
              denominator of a combined unit.  For example, ""m / sec / kg"
