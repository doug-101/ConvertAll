            <h1>How to Use ConvertAll</h1>

            <h2>Contents</h2>

            <ul>
                <li><a href="#basics">Basics</a></li>
                <li><a href="#combine">Combining Units</a></li>

            </ul>

            <h2><a name="basics"></a>Basics</h2>

            <p>Simply type a unit name in the "From Unit" edit window.  As you
            type, the list below the window will be filtered to show only
            matching units.  Matching unit names contain words starting with
            the words that are typed.  Either type the complete unit
            name/abbreviation or hit the return key to use the unit
            highlighted (blue letters) in the list.  Of course, clicking or
            tapping on a unit in the list will also add the unit to the edit
            window.  You may also use the up and down arrow keys to highlight
            nearby units from the list.</p>

            <p>Repeat the unit selection in the "To Unit" edit window.  When
            done, if the units are compatible, the numeric edit windows below
            the unit lists will activate.  A number may be entered into either
            numeric window and the other window will display the conversion
            result.</p>

            <h2><a name="combine"></a>Combining Units</h2>

            <p>The real strength of ConvertAll lies in its ability to combine
            multiple units.  Simply type the unit names with an '*' or a '/'
            between them.  This allows the entry of units such as "ft * lbf"
            or "mi / hr".  The '^' symbol may be used for exponents, such as
            "ft^3" or "ft * lbm / sec^2".  Negative exponents are allowed for
            units such as "sec^-1" (per second), but may switch the
            multiplication or division symbol ("ft * sec^-2" becomes "ft /
            sec^2").</p>

            <p>Multiplication and division have the same precedence, so they
            are evaluated left-to-right.  Parenthesis may also be used to
            group units in the denominator.  So "m / sec / kg" can also be
            entered as "m / (sec * kg)".  The version with parenthesis is
            probably less confusing.</p>

            <p>Clicking or tapping on a unit from the list generally replaces
            the unit nearest the cursor.</p>

            <p>The clear unit button in the header (lines with an X) may be
            used to empty the unit edit boxes to allow new units to be
            entered.</p>

            <p>The filter List button in the header (funnel image) can be used
            to show only one type of unit in the list.  Note that this doesn't
            show units that could be combined to form a type.</p>

            <h2><a name="nonlinear"></a>Non-Linear Conversions</h2>

            <p>The conversion of some units is non-linear.  Examples of these
            include the Fahrenheit and Celsius temperature scales (due to an
            offset zero point) and the American Wire Gauge (logarithmic).
            Non-linear units are labeled as such in the comments column.</p>

            <p>These units can be converted only when they are not combined
            with other units or used with an exponential operator.  Otherwise
            the conversion would not be meaningful.</p>

            <h2><a name="shortcut"></a>Shortcuts</h2>

            <p>When typing unit names, spaces are ignored, so they may be
            skipped.  It is also generally ignored if a plural form of the
            unit name is typed.  For squared and cubed units (positive
            exponents of 2 or 3) the "^" symbol does not need to be typed.</p>

            <p>When a partially typed unit is highlighted in the list (blue
            lettering), hitting enter will complete the name.  The up and down
            arrow keys can be used to highlight nearby units in the list prior
            to hitting enter.  The unit closet to the cursor will be
            replaced.</p>

            <p>The recent unit button in the header (clock image) opens a menu
            of recently used units and unit combinations.  The entire current
            unit combination is replaced with selections from this menu.</p>

            <p>The tab key can be used to cycle between the "From" and "To"
            unit test boxes and the "From" and "To" number editors.</p>

            <p>The number to be converted may be entered in either the "From"
            or "To" unit side.  Standard or scientific notation may be used,
            or an expression including the normal math operators (+, -, *, /)
            and parenthesis may be entered.</p>

            <h3><a name="numbering"></a>Number Base Conversions</h3>

            <p>The "Bases" menu item brings up a dialog that can convert
            between various numbering system bases.  There are entry boxes for
            decimal, hexadecimal, octal and binary.  A number can be entered
            into any of the boxes and equivalents will be shown in the
            others.</p>

            <p>The "Fractions" menu item brings up a dialog that can list
            fractional equivalents for a decimal number.  Type the number and
            press enter.  The fractions are listed in order of increasing
            accuracy.</p>

            <h2><a name="options"></a>Options</h2>

            <p>The "Settings" menu item allows for changing several default
            options.  These settings are automatically stored so that
            ConvertAll will re-start with the settings last used.</p>

            <p>The first options control the display of numerical results,
            including the use of scientific notation and the number of decimal
            places.  Be cautious about setting the number of decimal places to
            a low value, which can result in a significant loss of accuracy.
            Six places or higher is recommended (eight is the default).</p>

            <p>There is an option to set the number of recent units to be
            saved.  Setting it to zero will disable the recent unit button.
            Another option will automatically load the most recent previous
            units at startup.</p>

            <p>The remaining options control appearances.  The view scale ratio
            can be set to make the content smaller or larger (useful for
            high-dpi displays). The window size and position will be restored
            from the previous session use if enabled. The final setting selects
            between light and dark color schemes.</p>
